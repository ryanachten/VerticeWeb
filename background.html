                  <p>Moving from a 2D browsing model into a 3D counterpart presents a number of challenges and opportunities for archive interaction design. </p>
        
                  <p>A 3D digital artefact is comprised of a combination of 2D information (albedo texture, UV maps, normal maps etc), and 3D information (polygon mesh); necessitating a larger amount of data to be served to the user when browsing 3D archives. Consequently, fewer number of artefacts can be displayed to the user at one time without compromising software user experience.</p>
        
                  <p>Differences in media spatiality also prevent existing 2D archive browsing models from being mapped effectively to the Vertice interaction paradigm. Widely adopted models, such as image grids commonly featured in digital collections, lean upon representing 2D content, which would neglect interaction opportunities within a 3D context.</p>
        
                  <p>Instead, new models for exploring 3D digital archive content were devised during Vertice’s development. Vertice allows users to browse various metadata attributes and return relevant artefacts within a three-dimensional environment. The WASD computer game standard was adopted to allow simple navigation through the 3D environment. Since this is widely used in computer games we look to reduce novice user learning curves whilst providing a novel form of archive interaction. Upon reaching an artefact, Vertice uses raycasting techniques to display users with contextual information about the artefact.</p>
        
                  <p>Vertice has currently been constructed for standalone (for Windows, OS X, and Linux machines) and WebGL deployment and has the potential to be reconfigured for use through an array of platforms. Built using the gaming engine, Unity 3D, Vertice could be deployed for engagement in augmented or virtual realities, and even common gaming consoles such as PlayStation or XBox; opening up numerous opportunities for novel forms of archive interaction</p>

              <p>Vertice is not a collection management system. Instead, it is positioned to consume – from existing catalogues – a subset of the descriptive, structural, and administrative metadata that is relevant to understanding an artefact’s context, provenance, and technical details. This data populates Vertice’s metadata model, which Vertice uses to organise and describe the artefacts that have been imported into the system.</p>
    
              <p>The Vertice metadata model leans on the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, which prescribes fifteen units of information that are fundamental to describing an arbitrary resource. Vertice arranges these units of information to attest to the identity of an artefact, and the validity of its digital representation.</p>
