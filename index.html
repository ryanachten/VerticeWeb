            <p>Vertice is a platform that enables cultural institutions and their visitors to collate and interact with digitised and born-digital 3D objects. Vertice was developed using the gaming engine Unity to provide functionality that supports the purposeful arrangement, contextualisation, and presentation of digital artefacts.</p>

            <p>Through considered interaction design and subtle incorporation of gamification, Vertice anticipates how three-dimensional space can alter and enhance the way users interact with intangible cultural artefacts.</p>

					<h3>digitisation</h3>
					<p class="text-left">A variety of modern digitisation techniques – from sophisticated methods, such as MRI, to photogrammetry – empower everybody to produce digital 3D replicas of physical artefacts. See how <a href="http://www.123dapp.com/howto/catch">123D Catch</a> generates digital artefacts that could comprise a Vertice collection</p>

					<h3>import</h3>
					<p class="text-left">Vertice’s Import scene accessions an artefact’s 3D model, and associates it with contextual metadata that attests to its authenticity and cultural significance. An imported artefact will be available for browsing and organisation into collections</p>

				<div class="column vertice-function wow" id="browse">
					<img src="img/VerticeWeb_HomeIcon_Browse.png" class="wow thing-three">
					<h3>browse</h3>
					<p class="text-left">Information seeking for traditional media often takes place in two-dimensional space. Due to the three-dimensional nature of its content, Vertice reexamines this process and allows users to explore artefacts in a 3D environment that is idiomatic of a first-person video game</p>

				<div class="column vertice-function wow" id="collections">
					<img src="img/VerticeWeb_HomeIcon_Collect.png" class="wow thing-four">
					<h3>collections</h3>
					<p class="text-left">The Collection scene allows curators and visitors to group artefacts according to their own system of arrangement. This allows curators to preserve spatial relationships between artefacts, and prepare virtual exhibitions. It is also a space where could also allow visitors can gather their favourite artefacts</p>

					<h3>visualisation</h3>
					<p class="text-left">The gaming engine underlying Vertice supports many platforms. As such, it is possible to extend the software to support other forms of engagement: we envision that experiences could be created for virtual or augmented reality, gaming consoles, and mobile devices</p>

			<h2>who is vertice for?</h2>
			<div class="row small-up-1 large-up-5">
				<div class="column user-group">
					<h3>museums</h3>
					<p class="text-left">Due to the constraints of physical display space, a museum can only provide public access to a small number of artefacts at a time. Vertice is an organisation and presentation tool that resolves this problem by allowing institutions and their curators to digitise artefacts and exhibit them in a virtual space</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column user-group">
					<h3>libraries</h3>
					<p class="text-left">The roles and responsibilities of libraries have changed drastically to meet the need for modern forms of information, and the outreach and initiatives facilitated by the contemporary library synthesise many forms of media – not just books.</p>

          <p class="text-left">Given that libraries have become integral to movements such as makerspaces, there is a strong concordance between the content generated by libraries, and the organisation and presentation capabilities of Vertice</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column user-group">
					<h3>galleries</h3>
					<p class="text-left">While forms such as painting can are well-suited to photography for digital display, the added spatial dimension of sculpture and installation-based works necessitates a different approach for effective representation on screen. Vertice presents an opportunity for galleries to visualise their three-dimensional artefacts for archival and accessibility purposes</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column user-group">
					<h3>education</h3>
					<p class="text-left">In 2012, the modern use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning) had grown at 14 times the rate of traditional learning. Open education is fast growing to become the dominant form of education, for many reasons such as its efficiency and results compared to traditional methods.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column user-group">
					<h3>creatives</h3>
					<p class="text-left">One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called divergent production. Divergent production is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.</p>
